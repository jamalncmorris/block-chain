# Blockchain Basics: Who, What, When, Where, and Why

#### Who

* **Who invented blockchain?** Blockchain technology was first conceptualized by a person or group under the pseudonym *Satoshi Nakamoto* with the creation of Bitcoin in 2008.
* **Who uses blockchain?** Today, blockchain technology is used by a wide variety of entities, from individuals to corporations and governments. Its applications extend to cryptocurrency, supply chain management, digital identity, and more.

#### What

* **What is blockchain?** A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions across multiple computers. This technology makes it secure and nearly impossible to alter data without consensus from the network.
* **What are blocks?** Blocks are units of data that contain transaction records. Each block contains:
  * A list of transactions
  * A timestamp
  * A unique identifier called a hash
  * The hash of the previous block in the chain

#### When

* **When did blockchain start?** The first blockchain was introduced with Bitcoin in 2008. Since then, blockchain has evolved, and many blockchains now operate outside of cryptocurrency, especially since Ethereum's launch in 2015.
* **When is blockchain used?** Blockchain is used whenever data integrity, transparency, and trust are needed without relying on a centralized authority, such as in financial transactions, contracts, and secure data management.

#### Where

* **Where is blockchain stored?** Each node (computer) in a blockchain network has a copy of the entire blockchain. Since itâ€™s decentralized, the data is distributed globally.
* **Where is blockchain useful?** Blockchain is particularly useful in industries where security, transparency, and trust are critical, such as finance, healthcare, logistics, and government.

#### Why

* **Why was blockchain created?** Blockchain was created to enable trustless, secure digital transactions. The main motivation was to create a system where people could transfer value without needing an intermediary (like a bank).
* **Why use blockchain?** Blockchain ensures data integrity, prevents tampering, and provides transparency. It's also more resilient because of its decentralized nature, as there's no central point of failure.
